## So what is Barium?
Barium is a Fabric mod designed to improve the performance of chunk generation, I/O, and loading. This is done by taking advantage of multiple CPU cores in parallel. For the best performance it is recommended to use Barium with [Lithium](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric) and [Starlight](https://github.com/Spottedleaf/Starlight).

##So what is Barium not?
Barium is not affiliated with the CaffieneMC.
Barium is not production ready and still pretty experimental.
